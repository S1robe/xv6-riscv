If two processes are in contention for the core, then the one with the lowest entry in the process table will be picked.
This is does not imply that it entered first, because of the nature of the process table, if only index 49 is open, a 
a process is made, fills the entry. Then suddenly 1, 2, 3, open. The processes at 1, 2, 3 will run before 49, even 
though 49 entered first.
